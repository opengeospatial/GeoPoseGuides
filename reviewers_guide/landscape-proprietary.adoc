=== Software that Use or Generate Geospatially-anchored Position and Orientation

This section of the reviewer's guide captures information about commercial software and open source software and libraries that use or generate geospatially-anchored poses. It illustrates the diverse ways that geospatially-anchored poses are stored and represented.

The exercise shows the high potential to increase interoperability between a wide range of existing solutions when a developer chooses to implement the OGC GeoPose standard.

The table below documents, in a structured format, the features and functions of solutions identified at the time of publication of this guide.

Since new software is being introduced to address the requirements of use cases covered by GeoPose, this section could be maintained/updated periodically. If you have information to contribute to this section, or have recommendations and questions, please create an issue in https://github.com/opengeospatial/GeoPoseGuides/issues[this repo].

|Company or Open Source Project Name|Product or Service Name|Open Source?|"When this solution offers, generates or uses pose, is the pose (A) geospatially-anchored or (B) does it use an internally-defined (local) Frame of Reference?"|||Does this solution use a static spatial reference system? Can the adopter specify their SRS?||Please provide details about the spatial reference system used in this system||"In this solution, how is position represented?"|||"In this solution, how are orientation and rotation represented?"||"In this solution, is temporal information associated with poses?"|"If temporal information is associated, provide details"|Comments

Additional options beyond transform matrices (e.g., quaternions, heading/pitch/roll) are available via the CesiumJS API to control camera position at runtime."|||"CesiumJS can display time-dynamic data provided as CZML or KML or via API. The data contains samples of position over time and CesiumJS uses interpolation to create the complete path. While CZML or KML this data can be stored in Cesium ion for convenience, Cesium ion itself doesn't provide temporal features."|
