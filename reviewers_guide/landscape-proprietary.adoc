=== Software that Use or Generate Geospatially-anchored Position and Orientation

This section of the reviewer's guide captures information about commercial software and open source software and libraries that use or generate geospatially-anchored poses. It illustrates the diverse ways that geospatially-anchored poses are stored and represented.

The exercise shows the high potential to increase interoperability between a wide range of existing solutions when a developer chooses to implement the OGC GeoPose standard.

The table below documents, in a structured format, the features and functions of solutions identified at the time of publication of this guide.

Since new software is being introduced to address the requirements of use cases covered by GeoPose, this section could be maintained/updated periodically. If you have information to contribute to this section, or have recommendations and questions, please create an issue in https://github.com/opengeospatial/GeoPoseGuides/issues[this repo].
