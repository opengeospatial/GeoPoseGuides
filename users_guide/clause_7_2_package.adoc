==== Discussion

This is the informative text that most users will be looking for. Remember that hyperlinks are important. For example, each time a class name is used you can include a link back to the definition of that class (ex. <<abstract-city-object-concept,City Object>>)

The beauty of hypermedia is that users can quickly get the additional data they may need to understand your writing.
